# Architectural Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This is a Ruby on Rails 8 API-only ecommerce backend application implementing a multi-namespace architecture with clear separation between administrative and customer-facing operations. The system follows a service-oriented architecture pattern with business logic encapsulated in service classes, polymorphic product modeling for flexibility, and comprehensive authentication using devise_token_auth. The architecture demonstrates mature Rails patterns with proper layering, dependency injection through services, and horizontal scaling support via Redis/Sidekiq for background processing.

**Key Architectural Findings:**
- Well-structured namespace separation (Admin::V1, Storefront::V1)
- Service-oriented business logic implementation
- Polymorphic product modeling for extensibility
- Token-based authentication with role-based access control
- Comprehensive test coverage with shared examples pattern
- Docker-based development environment with service dependencies

**Architectural Patterns Identified:**
- **MVC with Service Layer**: Classic Rails MVC enhanced with service objects for complex business logic
- **Namespace Organization**: API versioning and functional separation through namespaces
- **Polymorphic Associations**: Product-productable relationship for extensible product types
- **Concern-based Mixins**: Reusable model and controller behaviors
- **Repository Pattern**: Implicit through ActiveRecord with custom scopes and concerns

## Critical Components Analysis

**Afferent Coupling** represents the number of classes that depend on a component (incoming dependencies), indicating how central and important a component is to the system. **Efferent Coupling** represents the number of classes that a component depends on (outgoing dependencies), indicating how complex and potentially fragile a component might be. Higher afferent coupling suggests a component is critical to many parts of the system, while higher efferent coupling suggests a component has many external dependencies.

DeviseTokenAuth → User → Admin/Storefront Controllers

API Request Flow:
Client → Admin::V1/Storefront::V1 Controllers → Services → Models → Database

Business Logic Flow:
Controllers → Service Classes → Domain Models → Database
Controllers → Service Classes → External APIs (implicit)

Data Access Flow:
Models → ActiveRecord → PostgreSQL
Models → ActiveStorage → File Storage
Models → Concerns (Paginatable, LikeSearchable, NameSearchable)

Background Processing Flow:
Controllers → Sidekiq Jobs → Redis Queue → Background Workers

Product Management Flow:
Admin Controllers → ProductSavingService → Product → Polymorphic Productable (Game)
Product → ProductCategory → Category (many-to-many)

```

## Integration Points

| Integration | Type | Location | Purpose | Risk Level |
|-------------|------|----------|---------|------------|
| PostgreSQL | Database | config/database.yml | Primary data persistence | Medium |
| Redis | Cache/Queue | Configured in Sidekiq | Background job processing and caching | Medium |
| DeviseTokenAuth | Authentication | mounted at /auth/v1/user | Token-based authentication system | High |
| Active Storage | File Storage | Rails built-in | Product image and file management | Low |
| CPF/CNPJ Validation | External Gem | cpf_cnpj gem | Brazilian document validation | Low |
| Sidekiq | Background Jobs | Background worker | Asynchronous task processing | Medium |
| Mailcatcher | Email Testing | Docker service (development) | Email testing in development environment | Low |
| CORS | Cross-Origin | rack-cors gem | API access from web applications | Medium |
| HTTParty | HTTP Client | HTTP service integration | External API communication capability | Low |

## Architectural Risks & Single Points of Failure

| Risk Level | Component | Issue | Impact | Details |
|------------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| Critical | DeviseTokenAuth Authentication | Single authentication system | System-wide access failure | All API access depends on token authentication; failure affects entire system |
| High | CheckoutProcessorService | Complex business logic concentration | Revenue impact | Single service handles all order processing; failure stops all purchases |
| High | PostgreSQL Database | Single database instance | Complete system failure | No database redundancy or clustering configured |
| Medium | Redis Instance | Background job dependency | Degraded performance | Single Redis instance for jobs and caching; failure affects async operations |
| Medium | Product Polymorphic Design | Tight coupling with productable types | Scalability constraints | Adding new product types requires code changes and migrations |
| Medium | Admin Authorization | Single role-based access | Administrative access failure | Admin access controlled through single enum field in User model |
| Low | ActiveStorage Configuration | File storage dependency | Feature degradation | Product images depend on storage configuration; affects product display |
| Low | CORS Configuration | API access restrictions | Client application failures | Improper CORS setup could block legitimate client applications |

## Technology Stack Assessment

**Core Framework & Language:**
- Ruby 2.7.1 with Rails 6.0.3 (API-only configuration)
- PostgreSQL 11 for primary data storage
- Redis 6.2.6 for caching and background job queuing

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- devise_token_auth for JWT-based API authentication
- Role-based access control through User profile enum (admin/client)
- Custom authorization concerns for namespace-level access control

**Background Processing:**
- Sidekiq 6.3.1 for asynchronous job processing
- Redis as message broker for job queuing
- Mailer jobs for email notifications

**API & Serialization:**
- Jbuilder for JSON response templating
- rack-cors for cross-origin resource sharing
- Namespace-based API versioning (v1)

**Development & Quality Tools:**
- RSpec for testing framework with FactoryBot for test data
- RuboCop for code style enforcement
- RubyCritic for code quality analysis
- SimpleCov for test coverage reporting
- Attractor for code complexity analysis

**Validation & Utilities:**

## Security Architecture and Risks

**Authentication Security:**
- **Strength**: Token-based authentication using devise_token_auth with proper token rotation
- **Risk**: No multi-factor authentication implementation
- **Risk**: Token storage and transmission security depends on HTTPS enforcement

**Authorization Model:**
- **Strength**: Clear namespace separation between admin and customer operations
- **Risk**: Simple enum-based role system may not scale for complex permission requirements
- **Risk**: No fine-grained permission system for different administrative roles

**Data Protection:**
- **Risk**: No apparent field-level encryption for sensitive data (CPF/CNPJ documents)
- **Risk**: Password reset tokens and confirmation tokens use default Rails mechanisms
- **Strength**: Database foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records

**Input Validation:**
- **Strength**: Comprehensive model-level validations and custom validators
- **Risk**: No apparent rate limiting or request throttling mechanisms
- **Risk**: File upload security depends on Active Storage default configurations

**API Security:**
- **Strength**: CORS configuration for controlled cross-origin access
- **Risk**: No apparent API versioning deprecation strategy
- **Risk**: Error messages may expose internal system information

**Infrastructure Security:**
- **Risk**: Docker configuration uses trust authentication for PostgreSQL
- **Risk**: No apparent secrets management system beyond Rails credentials
- **Risk**: Background job processing may handle sensitive data without encryption

**Session Management:**
- **Strength**: Stateless API design with token-based authentication
- **Risk**: Token expiration and refresh mechanisms need review for security best practices
